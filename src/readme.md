# Source code

This is the source code to MS-Engine which you need to use a compatible C++ compiler in order to compile. The `setup.hpp` module will try to detect and setup a compatible environment automatically so you do not need any special defines or flags except for specifying `ALPHA`, `BETA` or `RELEASE`.
