The **engine** source code was supplied for **reference only** so people can confidently trust the projects I make with it and try to help me improve it if necessary. However, it is also public as a result so I cannot stop anyone from doing what they want with it. My hope is that if you **only** do good things with this software, then it would be greatly appreciated if you could be as so kind as to credit me and help improve the source code farther.
